## Document Organization and Hierarchy

You structure your documentation using nested pages and folders, creating a clear information architecture. Drag and drop pages to reorder, and use frontmatter for metadata.

## Version Control for Docs

Personal integrates with Git for full version history. You commit changes, view diffs, and revert to previous versions.

<Expandable title="Advanced Git Workflow" default-open="false">
  Connect your repo for automatic syncs.
  
  ```yaml
  # .personal/config.yaml
  repo: https://github.com/your-org/project-docs.git
  branch: main
  syncInterval: 5m
  ```
</Expandable>

<CodeGroup tabs="Commit Changes,Revert Version">
  ```bash
  # Commit your edits
  git add .
  git commit -m "Update authentication guide"
  git push origin main
  ```
  ```bash
  # Revert to previous version
  git checkout HEAD~1 -- docs/authentication.mdx
  git push origin main
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Search and Filtering Tools

Quickly locate content with full-text search, tags, and filters. Support for advanced queries like `tag:api status:draft`.

| Filter Type | Example Query | Description |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| Tags | `tag:feature` | Find pages tagged as features |
| Status | `status:published` | Show only live docs |
| Date | `updated>2024-01-01` | Recent changes |

<Callout kind="success">
  Pro tip: Combine filters like `tag:api updated<30d` for the latest API updates.
